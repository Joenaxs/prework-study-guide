# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is motivated by my passion to learn, understand and become a full stack web developer. As part of our prework study guide, we have been encouraged to build our very first web page.
I have built this project to practice the skills acquired from the bootcamp program as part of my first web page.
The project itemises all the key fundamentals of a web page (HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript) and documents the usefulness of each element.
